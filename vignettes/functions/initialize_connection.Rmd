## Login to Virtual Machine 

Executing the following R Code let's you connect to three different Opal servers which are located on the Virtual Machine. Hence, the URL does not need to be secure (https). In a real-world scenario, where you would receive the credentials from collaborators to connect to their Opal Servers, you would change URL, user, password and table. In some cases, collaborators issue a token instead of user and password. 

```{r}
builder <- DSI::newDSLoginBuilder(.silent = FALSE)
builder$append(server = "DIfE",  url = "http://192.168.56.150:8080/",
               user = "user", password = "password",
               table = "CNSIM.CNSIM1", driver = "OpalDriver")
builder$append(server = "UKE",  url = "http://192.168.56.150:8080/",
               user = "user", password = "password",
               table = "CNSIM.CNSIM2", driver = "OpalDriver")
builder$append(server = "U Leipzig",  url = "http://192.168.56.150:8080/",
               user = "user", password = "password",
               table = "CNSIM.CNSIM3", driver = "OpalDriver")


logindata <- builder$build()
connections <- DSI::datashield.login(logins = logindata, assign = TRUE, symbol = "D")



```
